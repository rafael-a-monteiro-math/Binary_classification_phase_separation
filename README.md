# Binary classification as a phase separation process
Python code for the paper <b>Binary classification as a phase separation process</b>, by <b> <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/rafaelmonteiro-math/home>Rafael Monteiro </a></b>.

In this github you will the code for used in the paper and some examples of how to use/apply the model.

### Verifiability:
Posting all the trained models is impossible due to their size (almost 5gb). Therefore I'm making only the following trained models available:

a. Repeat-Nt-Jump, Nt = 4, Non-Diffusive, subordinated
b. Repeat-Nt-Jump, Nt = 4, Non-Diffusive, non-subordinated
c. Repeat-1-Jump, Nt = 4, Diffusive (Neumann BCs)
d. Repeat-Nt-Jump, Nt = 4, Diffusive  (Neumann BCs)
e. Repeat-1-Jump, Nt = 4, Diffusive  (Periodic)
f. Repeat-Nt-Jump, Nt = 4, Diffusive  (Periodic)

I'm glad to send them over for anyone who needs them while I cannot find a storage. Nevertheless, as soon as I find a storage to them I'll post the link here.

### Remarks:
All of them have been trained on clusters with 12 or 22 processors.

As I have proved in the paper, it is possible to parallelize the inviscid model, but it has not been implemented; you are welcome to do that if you want.
