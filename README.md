# Binary Classification as a Phase Separation Process
This is a Github with python code used in the paper 

<b>Binary Classification as a Phase Separation Process</b>, by <b> <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/rafaelmonteiro-math/home>Rafael Monteiro </a></b>.

In the main page you will also find  some examples of how to use/apply the model.

### Available Data and verifiability:
The dataset used in the paper is public: it is known as the <a href=http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/> MNIST database </a>.

Raw data and Computational statistics  are available at <li>10.5281/zenodo.4005131</li>

I included a script in this github that you can use to download all the data automatically: it gives you three options:
  1. download all statistics;
  2. download all examples;
  3. download all jupyter notebooks;
  4. download all raw data;
  

### Remarks:
All of them have been trained on a super computer with 12 or 22 processors.

As I have proved in the paper, it is possible to parallelize the inviscid model, but it has not been implemented; you are welcome to do that if you want.
