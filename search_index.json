I have posted a paper with all the mathematics behind the model. It is quite self contained, and you can “ignore” most of the references that I do to other theories (like my comments about maximum principles in parabolic and elliptic PDEs, etc). There is a preprint currently available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02467 There are many other examples of use in the jupyter-notebooks (for 1D toy problem, for MNIST) If you want to have access to the trainable examples I used, and to the computational statistics, you can either download the files PSBC_Examples.tar.gz and PSBC_computational_statistics.tar.gz at the companion data repository to this project at Zenodo. There is also this script in this git-hub that you can use to download all you need automatically. You only need wget and tar to use it. In this Github you will also find a manual named README.pdf to the data in the repository, and also the script download_PSBC.shand use it to download everything you need. There are instructions on how to run the script in the README.pdf file. "]
